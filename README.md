About HemoCell
==============

`HemoCell` is a framework for simulating suspensions of deformable cells, focusing on blood. It is based of the combined Immersed boundary-lattice Boltzmann method (IB-LBM) and is currently built on top of the open source `C++` lattice Boltzmann solver [`Palabos`](http://www.palabos.org).
