HemoCell
========

HemoCell is a parallel computing framework for simulation of dense deformable
capsule suspensions, with special emphasis on blood flows and blood related
vesicles (cells). The library implements validated mechanical models for
Red Blood Cells (RBCs) and is capable of reproducing emergent transport
characteristics of such complex cellular systems :cite:`Zavodszky:2017`.
HemoCell is capable of handling large simulation domain sizes and high shear-rate
flows providing a virtual environment to evaluate a wide palette of microfluidic
scenarios :cite:`zavodszky2019red,czaja2018cell,van2020haemodynamic`.

For the simulation of dense flows, HemoCell employs the Immersed Boundary
Method (IBM) to couple the immersed vesicles, e.g. RBCs, platelets (PLTs),
leukocytes, or other custom cell types to the fluid (e.g., plasma). The particles
are tracked using a Lagrangian discrete element approach, while the flow field is
implemented using the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM). The current implementation
is based on the `Palabos`_ library. HemoCell manages all required data structures,
such as materials and cell models (particles), their interactions within the flow field,
load-balancing, and communication among the processors.

The library provides validated and highly optimised mechanical models for the
simulation of red blood cells :cite:`tarksalooyeh2019optimizing,Alowayyed:2018`.
Furthermore, the library is extensible and allows to implement different mechanical
(cell) models :cite:`czaja2020influence,Haan:2018` and cell-binding techniques
:cite:`van2019identifying` to study numerous application-specific behaviour.

The code is implemented in C/C++ with parallelism achieved through `MPI
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface>`_, although only for
advanced use-cases the users are required to interact with the parallelism,
which is otherwise hidden from the user. The system is build with `CMake
<https://cmake.org/>`_ and runs on a variety of systems and HPC clusters (see
:ref:`getting started<QuickStart:HemoCell Getting Started>`).

Multiple examples are provided to illustrate typical use-cases of HemoCell:

* Developing mechanical models for different cell types and their interaction.
  These are typically quick running simulations on single processors (order of
  seconds to minutes) that aim to investigate/validate different formulations of
  mechanical models for the immersed cells, e.g.
  :ref:`shearing<cases/stretchcell:One stretching cell>`,
  :ref:`stretching<cases/onecellshear:One shearing cell>`, or
  :ref:`"parachuting"<cases/parachuting:A parachuting cell>` of a single cell.
  Additionally, one might want to study the interaction between colliding
  particles, e.g. :ref:`cases/cellCollision_interior_viscosity:Colliding cells
  with interior viscosity`.

* Studying large simulation domains with large number of immersed particles.
  These simulations are typically derived from straight channel flow conditions,
  where the domain size, number of immersed particles, and flow conditions are varied.
  These simulations can vary from quick running simulations on small hardware
  (desktop/workstation) to long lasting simulations on large HPC compute
  clusters with thousands of cores. Examples of smaller pipe flow cases are
  presented in :ref:`cases/pipeflow:Pipe flow` and
  :ref:`cases/pipeflow_with_preinlet:Pipe flow with periodic inflow`.
