oneCellShear
------------

The oneCellShear case is used for validation of the material models used in
HemoCell. A single cell is initialized in a domain with periodicity turned on in
all directions. Then the domain is sheared such that the top moves in the
positive x-direction and the bottom in the negative x-direction. The largest
diameter is reported and validated against experimental data.


The most important adjustable variables are in the ``config.xml`` file.

- ``<domain><shearrate>`` the shear rate in reciprocal seconds, used to
  calculate the top and bottom velocity boundary conditions.

Furthermore, it is possible to do tanktreading by adjusting ``''RBC_HO''``
throughout the oneCellShear.cpp file to ``''RBC_HO_tt''``. This loads the
different .pos file present within the directory (RBC_HO.xml and RBC_HO_tt.xml)
are the same.
