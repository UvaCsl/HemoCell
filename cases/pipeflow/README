Pipeflow
--------

The pipeflow case is a very generic case that can readily be used as a basis for
many other projects. The domain is a tube (loaded from ``tube.stl``) with
periodicity in the x-direction. The domain is (depending on the config files)
initialized with Red Blood Cells and Platelets with an hematocrit of 40%

The most important adjustable variables are in the ``config.xml`` file.

- ``<domain><refDirN>`` This controls how much fluid cells there are
  perpendicular to the flow direction, that is the same as the diameter of the
  pipe. One fluid cell usually translates to 0.5µm in reality. Therefore this
  parameter controls the size of your pipe!
- ``<domain><Re>`` Used to calculate the driving force of the periodic pipeflow
  system. The Reynolds number corresponds to the one that would be found when
  the system is run without any cells! Therefore velocities might be a bit lower
  than expected with cells present. If you set this too high the simulation will
  become unstable!
- ``<domain><geometry>`` which stl file do you read in? the default is a simple
  periodic pipe.


The default ``*.pos`` file contain many positions for the red blood cells generated
by the packcells tool. When you increase the size of the pipe
more cells will fit but only according to these ``*.pos`` files. You might want to create your own distributions with the
following tool: :ref:`packcells`
